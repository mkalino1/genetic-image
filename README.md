# Genetic Image Evolution

A web application that uses genetic algorithm to recreate target images using geometric shapes. Upload any image and watch as the algorithm evolves a population of shapes to match it through iterative selection, crossover, and mutation.

:construction: Work in progress :construction:

## Features

- 🔄 **Real-time evolution** with live visual updates
- ⚙️ **Configurable parameters** (population size, mutation rate, shapes per individual)
- 🧬 **Hybrid fitness function** combining SSIM and Euclidean distance
- 🔺 **Multiple shape types** (circles, rectangles, triangles)
- 🎨 **Modern Vue.js interface** with Nuxt UI

## Built with

- Vue.js 3 + Nuxt 4 + TypeScript
- HTML5 Canvas for rendering
- Custom genetic algorithm implementation
- SSIM and Euclidean distance for image comparison
